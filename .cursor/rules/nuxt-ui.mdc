Purpose
- Provide conventions for building UI components, using Nuxt UI, and upgrading/styling components.

Component structure
- Keep components small and focused; prefer props and events for communication.
- Use `app/components/ui/` for shared primitives and `app/components/` for page-specific components.

Styling
- Use Tailwind & utility classes when possible. Keep Tailwind classes in templates, not inlined styles.
- Support theming via CSS variables and a `useTheme` composable.

Accessibility
- Ensure components support ARIA attributes and keyboard interactions.
- Provide accessible labels and roles for interactive elements.

Upgrading Nuxt UI
- When upgrading, run visual regression tests and linting (tailwindcss, eslint) to catch breaking style changes.
- Replace deprecated primitives with new equivalents and add migration notes in the rule.

Documentation
- Each shared UI component must have a short README with props, events, and examples.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- The Nuxt UI MCP server provides structured component, composable, example, and template data that AI assistants can query.
- Configure the project MCP client for common tools by adding `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, or other tool-specific configs pointing to `https://ui.nuxt.com/mcp`.

Using MCP in Development
- Use MCP to discover component implementations and metadata when authoring or reviewing components.
- When creating or updating UI components, confirm the MCP metadata (props, slots, events) matches the local component README.
- Use MCP `list_components` and `get_component_metadata` to validate prop types, default values, and available slots.

Component selection and migration
- Use the MCP `find_component_for_usecase` prompt to locate the best built-in component for a UI pattern before implementing a custom component.
- Use `get_migration_guide` to check version-specific migration steps when upgrading Nuxt UI.

Example workflows
- Discover component by category:
```
// Query the MCP server for a component list in the 'form' category
const components = await mcp.nuxtUi.list_components({ category: 'form' })
```
- Retrieve detailed metadata for a specific component:
```
const metadata = await mcp.nuxtUi.get_component_metadata({ name: 'UButton' })
// Verify props and slots before usage
```
- Fetch usage example and adapt it into local component README:
```
const example = await mcp.nuxtUi.get_example({ id: 'contact-form' })
```

Available Prompts

The Nuxt UI MCP server provides guided prompts for common workflows:
